1. Back slash:- it is continuation sign.
Ex. print*("hello \
            welcome")
           
2. triple Quotes:-represent the strings containing both single and double quotes to eliminate the need of escaping any.
Ex:- print("""this is python session""")

3.String inside the quotes:-there are 2 way to declared on string inside the quotes.
Ex.  1)  print('hello world')
     2)   print("python's World")
   
4. Escape Sequence of String:- the backslash "\" is a special character, also called the "escape" character.and"\t" is a tab, "\n" is a newline, and "\r" is a carriage return are used.
 Ex:- print("hello\tworld")
      print("welcome\nhome")
     
5.Formatted output:- There are several ways to present the output of a program, data can be printed in a human-readable form, or written to a file for future use.
Ex:- name=ABC
     age=24
     print("the name of person is", name," age is",age)
     
 # variable:- variables means linking of the data to name or A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values.
 Ex:- a=20
 
#  Rules to variable
1.  A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
2.  A variable name cannot start with a number.
3.  A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
4.  Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# python Operator:-
there are 7 type of operator
1.  Arithmatic operator
2.  Comparison Operator
3.  Assignment Operator
4.  Bitwise Operator
5.  Logical operator
6.  Membership Operator
7.  Identity Operator

# Arithmatic Operator:- Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.
   1.    + Addition
   2.    - Subtraction
   3.    * Multiplication
   4.    / Division
   5.    % Modulus
   6.    ** Exponentiation
   7.    // Floor division
   
   # Comparision Operator:-Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
   1.    == Equal
   2.    != Not equal
   3.    > Greater than
   4.    < Less than
   5.    >= Greater than or equal to
   6.    <= Less than or equal to
   
   #  Assignment Operator:-Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.used = operator.
   #  Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:-
   1.   & AND
   2.  | OR
   3.   ^ XOR
   4.  ~ NOT
   5.  << Zero fill left shift
   6.  >> Signed right shift
   
  # Logical operator:-Logical operators are used to combine conditional statement.
  1.  and
  2.  or
  3.  not
 
  # Membership Operator:-Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.
  1.  in
  2. not in
 
  #  Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory locationIdentity Operator.
  1.  is
  2.  is not
